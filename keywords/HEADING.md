# HEADING
***Type:*** text
***Length:*** 256 character per value
***Multiline:*** Yes

At least one of the keywords [STUB](STUB.md) or `HEADING` must be included. Usually
both are included, as you choose one or several variables for the stub and the
heading, respectively. The keywords are followed by a list with the chosen
variables. The variables are within quotation marks and separated by
commas. If the list with the variables has to be divided up into several lines,
this should be done after a comma and not within the variable name.
