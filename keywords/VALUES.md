# VALUES
**Type:** text
**Length:** 256 characters per value
**Multiline:** Yes

The keyword `VALUES` occurs once for each variable in the table, and is
followed by the variable name in parentheses, within quotation marks. The
values will be in the same order as in the stub and heading, respectively.
They are within quotation marks and separated by commas. Each value name
must not exceed 256 characters. If the values have to be divided up into
several lines, this should be done after a comma and not within the value
name. See also the keyword [TIMEVAL](TIMEVAL.md) below.
