# DESCRIPTION
**Type:** text
**Length:** N/A
**Multiline:** Yes

If a file contains `DESCRIPTION`, when fetching from a disk, this text is used
to show the contents of the disk. C.f. [TITLE](TITLE.md).
If the user wants to save a file in PC-AXIS and writes a text that describes
the file, this text will be saved as `DESCRIPTION`. The text will be used to
show the contents of tables in the SUBJECT AREA. The text is not
presented as a note nor in any other way when the table is presented on the
screen unless the keyword [DESCRIPTIONDEFAULT](DESCRIPTIONDEFAULT.md) is used. In this case
the description is shown instead of the title.
